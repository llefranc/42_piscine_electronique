# EEPROM

- `ex00`: write a simple value to the EEPROM and read it.
- `ex01`: write several values to the EEPROM and read each of them.
- `ex02`: write values and additionnal data before it (magic number, length).
- `ex03`: write values, read them and free them, using an uint16_t as id stored in front of each value and identifying them.
- `ex04`: write values, read them and free them, using this time a string instead of uint16_t as id.
