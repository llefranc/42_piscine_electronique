# SPI protocol

- `ex00`: use SPI serial communication to turn in red a RGB LED connected to the SPI bus.
- `ex01`: use SPI to display several colors on a RGB LED connected to the SPI bus.
- `ex02`: use SPI to turn on and off the 3 RGB LEDs connected to the SPI bus.
- `ex03`: read the value of the potentiometer, convert it to a RGB code and use SPI to display this value on the RGB LEDs.
- `ex04`: receive from computer using UART a RGB color code and use SPI to display it on a specific RGB LED.
- `ex05`: read the value of the potentiometer, convert it to a RGB color code, select a LED with the button and use SPI to display the RGB color code.
